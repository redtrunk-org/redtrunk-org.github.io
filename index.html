        <blockquote>"When, on Saturday morning early, forty miles out at sea, a small steamship ran into and punched an ugly hole in the side of a great 
        steamship with five hundred people on board, the world knew of the disaster in a few minutes. The man at the wireless key on the damaged 
        steamship gave a few clicks on his instrument. He sounded the marine code meaning danger and distress. Then a wireless man on shore, on 
        Nantucket, caught the signal, and all other business of the wireless was suspended. From the shore was sent a general alarm to all vessels 
        within a radius of two hundred miles, and it was not long before replies were received from two or three boats some of them one hundred miles 
        distant, saying they would go to the scene of the trouble. And the man at the key on the damaged vessel - the Republic of the White Star 
        line - sat at his desk. He kept the people on shore, and thus the people throughout the world, informed as to the condition of the ship, 
        and before he got though it was sent out that everybody had been taken from the ship in safety&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;."</blockquote>

        Thus began one newspaper reporter's column describing the collision of the SS Florida with White Star Line's steamship RMS Republic 50 miles 
        off the coast of Nantucket, Massachusetts on January 23rd 1909. The SS Florida remained sea worthy but the Republic did not. The RMS Republic 
        was lost while under tow back to New York the following day.</p>
      
        <p>Thanks almost entirely to the presence of wireless radio equipment and operators aboard the RMS Republic, other ships in the area, and onshore, 
        over 1500 passengers and crew were rescued from the Florida and Republic. Only six passenger and crew members were lost during the event.</p> 
   
        <p>Redtrunk.org now provides access to the most comprehensive collection of newspaper coverage of the RMS Republic's collision and ultimate loss. 
        Employing high definition digital photography, it reveals for the first time, the content of a recently re-discovered scrapbook compiled in 1908 
        by my Great Grandfather, Theodore Minturn Sammis. The scrapbook's 122 pages contain thousands of column inches of newspaper reporting on of the 
        RMS Republic event, with details, diagrams and photographs perhaps unavailable elsewhere. </p> 
   
        <p>Given the historical significance of the RMS Republic's sinking and of my Grandfather's scrapbook, it was decided that the scrapbook's contents 
        should be made public and available to everyone. It's therefore been released on this site under the terms of the 
        <a href=https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/>Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike</a> license.</p>
